Study this material to learn more about Javascript and jQuery. 

Notes:

JS is very C like. It has semicolons that end each statement, similar function definitions
to C, and it has other things like Python-like method calling. For example, in library.js,
the first if statement has a var target which sets itself equal to self.location.href.split("?");
This makes Javascript easier for me to grasp. Neato!

Heh, they pulled from a github repository for their slideshow. Nice. I guess that would mean
that I need to add jQuery html files in the directory in order to make it work. I did not include
the jQuery html files, as far as I know. It looks like they define methods that the JS file uses
for their functions. Oh yeah, and any code that I used from this original site I should attribute
to the proper people. Duh.

The jquery file I have, jquery.html, seems to be a basic 404 error page. I will need to process
error handling and make it work on my own... or I guess I could just overwrite the jquery thing.
I have no clue. In any case, it looks like I will need to add jquery to my toolbelt. I will look
online for jquery classes and continue my studies there.

To do:

Implement basic jquery tasks for the site.

Learn some basic javascript.

Implement it with bootstrap... if applicable.
