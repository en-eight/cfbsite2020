##### March 2020

*03/01/2020* - I added the changelog.md file. It will be really useful to keep 
track of what work was done and when. To be honest, school has been difficult
and it has been tough to keep up with the site, but I have an extra twenty mins
before my sleeping pills kick in- might as well use them. 

*Main features so far*

- `src` directory contains all of the source material for the site
(images, scripts for the site, html documents, etc etc.) I am currently working
on the index.php file, aka the home page. I only have the header worked out, but
this week I plan on creating the main content for the page. 

- `documentation` directory contains **internal, non essential information** about
the website. It is for **reference only** and is not meant to be read or viewed by
the client. Please take note of this, it's important. In this, I have a few files
which I write to from time to time detailing how to write to the site, change files,
and soon enough, commit to the repository should I end up leaving CFB. I'll make sure
that if or when I leave that all of this information will be readily available and
well documented so that it's easy to pick up on.

- `templates` directory contains all templates for the site. For right now it 
only has a boilerplate HTML document that you can copy/paste into a new file,
but eventually these templates will be diversified and updated for more specific
use cases. For example, I want to make a template for user submission pages, akin
to a "Contact Us" page. That same template could easily be used again for any form
submission pages. This would save tremendous time and effort, and will definitely
permit some really quick deployment in the near future.

*to do this week*

- actually come into the office once this month

- hammer out kinks in index.php header

- create stylebook for unified look across the site (this will take a while)
