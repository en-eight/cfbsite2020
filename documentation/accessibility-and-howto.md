##### Important Details 

**1.) Bootstrap REQUIRES a container for elements.** In layman's terms, if you
are going to pin an index card on the wall, you need posterboard first. To do
this, all you need to do is define your main div with one of two containers:

`<div class = "container">` will make a fixed width responsive container, and
`<div class = "container-fluid>` will make a full width responsive container.
