## This is the README for `cfbsite2020` repository. 

----

There are a few things that this README seeks to address; in general I seek to 
indentify what the purpose of the redesign is and what the strategy is as well.
Of course, I will forward this document to CFB as well. 


Contents: 

a.) What's the strategy? Audience?
b.) What design trends can we follow to maximize aesthetic appeal?
c.) After deployment, what can we do to improve the website?

#### a.) What's the strategy? Audience?

**Summary**: Make CFB's site adapt to our users. Our audience should start to 
adapt to a younger crowd. User interaction is really important.

I think the main strategy with the website is to deliver a dynamic experience
for the end user. In layman's terms, what this means is to make the website 
change to the person using it, making it a unique experience (ideally) with 
every interaction with our website. In web design this is a principle called 
**Web 2.0** which allows for user generated content to flourish. Of course, 
since our website isn't Facebook or Youtube, we're not really focused on making
our content user generated, but rather making our content dynamic *to* the end
user. 

Really I'm simply suggesting that we make form submission a thing, add scripts
that interact with the user's sent data and return a result based on the data. 
This still enables dynamic interaction between users and us (instead of just a 
static wall of text like we have now) but without taking it to an extreme. This
middle ground is very much what we're aiming for. 

This is a difficult task but once it's completely implemented, it would enable 
our customers to interact with us wihtout having to be in the bank. Think of 
special features enabled by the internet that would enable multiple channels of
user interaction with Community First. 

As is usually the case with new ventures, our main target is to target Gen Z 
with these dynamic communication channels. It would make sense to organize some
Q&A pages online with comment sections or something so that customers can ask 
questions regarding *general financial needs*, that is, no personal info given.
Adopting a "community first" approach is literally in our name, so wouldn't it 
make sense to do it this way? We update our pages, have people ask us questions
online, then we respond. It's blatantly giving our customers a chance to speak 
their minds.

#### b.) What design trends can we follow to maximize aesthetic appeal?

**Summary**: Take a look at our competitors, see what they do right and wrong,
then formulate a design strategy that attempts to make the best of our research

We look at online banks and we can tell right away from the website itself how
good or bad our experience will be. Take for example -

1.) https://www.huntington.com/ - this is a good website, here's why:

Pros:
- vibrant color scheme -> white, grey, spring green color
- woman with glasses on front page, no dated technology or anything
- current events show relevance and attention being paid to how Huntington
treats their customers
- mission statement and goals clearly visible on front page
- font is clear, clean, easy to read
- mobile adaptive, meaning that it resizes cleanly 

Cons:
- a bit of information overload, there are a lot of buttons and text
- duplicate links - security can be found twice on the same page

There isn't much else to say about it- it's a well designed website.



Next, HSLC Kenton, one of our competitors. 

2.) https://www.hslc-kenton.com/ - this is a pretty good site, here's why:

Pros:
- Good color scheme, I like the white and red. 
- Minimalistic, simple. There is a calm, concise mannerism about this page. 
- Dynamic display with an image slideshow, inviting and can be fun.
- Mouseover effects on their Personal Checking/Real Estate Loans, etc. Neat.
- Doesn't rely solely on text to convey information, more visual.
- Mobile ready adaptation. It's very nicely resized for smaller displays. 

Cons:
- It might be a little too barren. I wish there was a little more info.
- No transitions on the mouseover FX. Reminds me of webpages from 2005. Janky.
- Sanitized, by which I mean I don't really see any heart or anything. Generic.
- Text over images isn't centered, also some color clashing (text hard to read)
- VERY noticable color clashing on the Drive in Style panel. Hard to read.

Overall, not bad. Definitely some changes I'd make but it's good as is. 

I could go on and start comparing more sites, but I think this is clear enough.
Essentially the main goals for the new site are as follows:

1. Make user interaction a priority. We are trying to sell an experience.
2. A fresh clean look would be nice. Clean colors, nice fonts, and simple UI.
3. Synchronized info between the building and the website. More on this later.
4. Seriously, KISS. Keep It Simple, Stupid. 

No, that doesn't mean that you're stupid! It's actually a design principle in 
software development where programming should be as simple as possible. This 
maximizes efficiency and minimizes effort on the end of the developer. Likewise
this will maximize functionality for the end user but maintain simplicity to 
create and make changes to the site for the back end, being us. 

At the core of these ideas is one centric principle- ***simplicity.*** It's 
a good idea to keep everything as easygoing as physically possible so that we 
can make changes easily.

#### c.) After deployment, what can we do to improve the website?

To be honest, this is the point where we need to make a distinction between the
work and ourselves. If the users don't respond well to the site, that's okay. 
Opinions don't define the work that went into this and we should be proud of 
that. That being said, the main thing we can do is receive user input. Opinions
are the fuel to the fire of change. If we can make it such that the users can 
state their opinions about the site on say a public forum like Facebook, it 
gives them a chance to be heard while also giving us invaluable input.
