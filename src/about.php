		<p> Community First Bank, N.A. was founded in 1904. 
		The bank was then known as the First National Bank of Forest, Ohio. 
		In 1981, a branch opened in the neighboring community of Kenton, Ohio. 
		At that time, the bank changed its name to Community First Bank, National Association. 
		The reasoning behind the name change was simple: 
		Community First is a local bank for all our communities where the customers are “First With Us!”   
		In 2002, Community First opened another office in the heart of downtown Upper Sandusky, Ohio. </p>
			
		<p> Community First Bank, N.A. is a locally owned, controlled, family oriented bank, dedicated to
		providing a safe, secure, competitive source of financial services to the residents of our community,
		small businesses, and family farms in our market area. It is further our mission to provide our
		shareholders with an adequate return on their investment in terms of both short-term yield and long-term
		growth while preserving a well-capitalized corporation. It is our mission to offer our employees quality
		employment where they are treated with respect and evaluated on their contributions to the goals and
		objectives of Community First Bank, N.A. </p>
